# Find-Palinedrome
ECE 0302 Data Structure and Algorithms with C++ Project 2  

In this project we will be implementing a C++ class called FindPalindrome.  

Description: When we create an instance of this class, we can add words to the instance, and the instance will figure out all orders of the words that form sentence palindromes. For example, if I were to add the words: "Odd". "Even", "Never", and "or" to an instance it should figure out that "Never Odd or Even" is a sentence palindrome
